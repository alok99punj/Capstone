Project Description 

This research investigates the enhancement of bike repositioning in a dock-based bike- sharing system using reinforcement learning (RL). The study juxtaposes the RL-based approach with a conventional greedy strategy, wherein bikes are loaded or unloaded until the station or truck capacity is optimized. Through the utilization of Reinforcement Learning (RL), the suggested method effectively adjusts repositioning choices by taking into account the ever-changing demand patterns. The results demonstrate that the RL model outperforms the greedy method in terms of efficiency and flexibility. This highlights the potential of the RL model to improve the overall performance and sustainability of bike-sharing systems by reducing operational costs and increasing user accessibility.
